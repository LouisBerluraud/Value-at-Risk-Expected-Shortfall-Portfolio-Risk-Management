# Value-at-Risk-Expected-Shortfall-Portfolio-Risk-Management
Historical Approaches, Monte Carlo Simulations, Hidden Markov Models and Rockafellar-Uryasev Optimization

Understanding and managing risk is a core challenge in finance, especially in markets driven by uncertainty, volatility and regime changes.
In this project, we focus on Value at Risk (VaR) and Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR), exploring both their theoretical foundations and practical limitations.
It is an interactive web application built with Streamlit, covering key concepts of risk modeling and portfolio optimization.

In this project, we talk about:
- An overview of VaR and CVaR and why tail risk matters
- Historical and Variance Covariance VaR models
- Monte Carlo simulations, including correlated asset returns
- Hidden Markov Models to capture market regimes
- Portfolio optimization using the Rockafellar–Uryasev framework

The application allows users to build their own portfolios, simulate downside risk under different models and optimize allocations in a coherent risk framework.

Please note: this work is not perfect, but we hope it adds value. We would love to hear your thoughts or feedback in the comments.
